# Emails-Classification-algorithm
The code aims to build a classification model that is able to predict an email’s topic based on that email’s content using Natural Language Processing. 
Various algorithms, such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), are employed to predict email categories.
The four categories are Crime, Politics, Science, and Other.
Part 1 is data preparation, part 2 is the training process, part 3 is the testing process, and part 4 is results visualization.
